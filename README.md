# The Story Behind Minesweeper Rebirth

Minesweeper Rebirth was my first-ever project.

In the fall of 2018, I hardly knew anything about computer science and software engineering. However, the Android development classes I took on Udacity inspired me to start my own project.

And by the time I finished Minesweeper Rebirth, I learned many things, and perhaps most important of them all, I realized that this is what I want to do full time, developing software.

Furthermore, I even managed to upload the finished game to the Google Store.

And until it got took down around the end of 2020 because of too many similarities with other minesweeper games, some people enjoyed playing it, which was a great source of happiness for me.
