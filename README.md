# Minesweeper Rebirth
I made Minesweeper Rebirth during the fall of 2018.

My goal was to create my first-ever app and learn about Java and Android.

# Highlights
* Built an Android- and Java-based game engine from scratch, which I used to create a fully functional 2D gaming experience.
* Published the app on the Google Store and effectively used the AdMob API to introduce monetization.

# Technologies Used
* Java
* Android SDK

# Results
More than 100 people downloaded and enjoyed playing Minesweeper Rebirth until it got taken down around the end of 2020 because of too many similarities with other minesweeper games.

# Inspiration
The inspiration behind Minesweeper Rebirth was [Google's Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/search?q=play+minesweeper).
